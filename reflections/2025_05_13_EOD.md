## 🌅 End of Day Reflection – 2025-05-13

### ✅ Tasks Today
- [x] Built George AI task planner
- [x] Logged mental reflections in markdown
- [X] Reviewed travel log and prelim plan for 2025-2027
- [A] Added worked on stocks. Made nice spreadsheet with startegy 
  

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Typo in `task_manager.py` reminded me to slow down
- Felt grounded when using markdown—structure brings peace
- Good day for “mental clarity”; no excess stress
- Loved the data/patterns and stucture developed
- Want to make sure that what I developed is sustainable/reproducable

### 🔁 Carry Forward
- Improve visual task display
- Add task completion feature
- Summarize `.md` logs into GeorgeAI memory model

### Pacing and workflow
- I worked for many hours straight. Though I enjoyed it, I think mental breaks should be a focus
- I have a time utility on the desktop that can be set for diff intervals (work & rest). Data saved to .csv
- Want to make sure that lead with working out 1st
  
### 🧘 Closing Mood
> Grateful, focused. Built something meaningful today.

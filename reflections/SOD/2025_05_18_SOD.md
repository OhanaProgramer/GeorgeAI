# 🌅 SOD – 2025-05-18

## 🧭 Intent & Focus
- Continue reinforcing voice integration with GeorgeAI while maintaining overall system coherence.
- Today's focus: refinement through closure — push small systems across the finish line.

## ✅ Top Priorities
- [ ] Complete SU (Summarizer) menu item
- [ ] Test task handling for DS/DE file creation logic
- [ ] Health: honor AM + PM stretching block
- [ ] Relationship: share one meaningful verbal appreciation
- [ ] ExoPlanet: draft event or task logic for ship behavior
- [ ] Reflection: log new “calm” moment before EOD

## 🔄 Context Carryover
- Menu logic (S/I/E/T/DS/DE) fully functional and voiced
- Voice debug output silenced; GeorgeAI now speaks appropriately and politely on errors
- Tasks templated with proper fields: module, priority, time block, etc.

## 🧘‍♂️ Mindset
> “Small wins compound when focus is clear and purpose is quiet.” Today is a stitch-in-the-fabric day — tidy the threads, rest in the rhythm.

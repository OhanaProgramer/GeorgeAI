# 🌅 SOD – 2025-05-17

## 🧭 Intent & Focus
- Grounded, steady start. Continue leveraging GeorgeAI as a stabilizer and guide.
- Today’s focus: clarity through consistency — micro-efforts across Spanish, Unity, and mental calm.

## ✅ Top Priorities
- [ ] Email out volunteer application (anchor task)
- [ ] Unity: another short, focused micro-session — small wins, build flow
- [ ] Spanish: Duolingo + update CSV tracking
- [ ] Calm app session
- [ ] Relationship: intentional moment of kindness
- [ ] Choose between visiting the baths or an alternate light activity

## 🔄 Context Carryover
- Spanish CSV structure and video tracking in place — build habit
- GeorgeAI defined more fully: Cognitive Companion + Daily Ops System
- Momentum from yesterday’s recovery and clarity — hold the line, no need to surge

## 🧘‍♂️ Mindset
> Let today be a low-friction path — small progress, well aimed, opens the door to deeper flow tomorrow.

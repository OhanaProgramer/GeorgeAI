# 🌇 End of Day – 2025-05-14

### 🔁 Daily Theme: *Wellness Wednesday*

---

## ✅ What Got Done (Cross-checked with Task File & SOD)
### 🔧 GeorgeAI
- ✅ *Sketch layout for visual task UI*
- 🔄 Continued design and notes on `generate_sod_from_eod()` and module logic
- ❌ Markdown parser and dynamic dataset linking deferred
- 🔄 Confirmed static UI working; queued future dynamic engine

### 🌍 Travel
- 🔄 Paris → Norway transit options: noted as pending
- ❌ No updates to Banff lodging or fall Portugal research
- ❌ Master travel plan not updated

### 🧠 Health
- ❌ Health log not written
- ❌ No stretching or posture tracking
- ❌ Hydration goal (3L) not confirmed
- ⚠️ Knee condition worsened, indicating today *should have* been a health reset day
- 🧱 Action item created for tomorrow: *Begin structured bodywork protocol*

---

## 📉 Missed or Deferred Tasks (from task file)
- Health module: All items unchecked (body awareness log, hydration, shoulder tension)
- Travel: 4 items still pending
- Free Time: Grocery walk & journaling not logged
- Things2: All 3 tasks (Lisa visit, iPhone shortcut, VA dental call) still open

## 🧘‍♂️ Reflection
### 📌 What I Learned
- Pushing through mentally rewarding tasks is great, but not at the cost of physical wellness.
- The consistency of tracking modules (EOD/SOD/tasks) is working — **GeorgeAI is gaining shape**.
- Automation won’t just help—it’s *needed* for multi-domain task continuity.

### 🧭 Adjustments Needed
- **Tomorrow starts the Health Project:** bodywork, rest logging, and mobility awareness
- Recalibrate travel updates into bite-sized, time-blocked chunks
- Add “dynamic summary generation” to GeorgeAI roadmap (from markdown + JSON)

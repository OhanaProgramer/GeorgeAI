# 🤖 Project Forrest – Autonomous Safety Robot

## 🌟 Purpose
Project Forrest is a long-term build of an autonomous robot designed to provide **safety, assistance, and presence**—whether for solo travel, van life, or domestic support.

Its aim is to blend **mobility, perception, and judgment** using onboard sensors and AI for human-centered support.

## 🛠️ Core Functions (Phase 1–2)
- Mobile base (wheels or tread) for interior/exterior use
- Sensor suite: cameras, ultrasonic, lidar, GPS
- Basic obstacle avoidance and room patrol
- Voice I/O for command and feedback
- Alert system via lights, sounds, or mobile notification

---

## 🔄 Mid-Term Goals (Phase 3+)
- Follow mode for outdoor walks or campsite movement
- Van integration: monitor interior, battery, door status
- Remote control via app or web dashboard
- On-device AI for facial recognition and gesture input

---

## 🧠 Future Potential
- Integration with GeorgeAI for health checks, reminders, remote voice presence
- Emergency fall-detection and SOS system
- Environmental sensors (air quality, heat, CO)
- Companion-style interaction: conversation, music, journaling prompts

## 🔜 Next Steps
- [ ] Outline chassis design and dimensions
- [ ] Select dev platform (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Jetson Nano)
- [ ] Begin basic mobility and object avoidance tests
- [ ] Identify AI use cases requiring on-device inference

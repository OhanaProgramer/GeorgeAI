# 🤖 GeorgeAI – Vision & Architecture (Living Document)

## 🌟 Purpose
GeorgeAI is a lifelong assistant: reflective, helpful, and modular. It supports mental clarity, creative growth, and purposeful living.

Its mission is to serve as a calm, intelligent presence across your daily systems—from task planning and journaling to deep analysis and long-term memory.

---

## 🧱 Core Architecture (v1–v2)
- Local-first system with fallback to OpenAI API
- Modular markdown logs: SOD, EOD, Health, Projects
- Task system via JSON
- Theme-driven daily prompts
- Human-readable → AI-readable file structure
- Command-line interface for simplicity

---

## 🔄 Future-Ready Expansion (v3–v5+)
- **SQLite + Graph DB** for structured memory
- **Vector embeddings** of logs and reflections
- **Weekly/monthly summaries** via LLM
- Voice integration (Whisper + pyttsx3 or ElevenLabs)
- GPT-native or fine-tuned model trained on your style
- “RAG”-based memory recall from logs and database

---

## 🧠 ML & Deep Learning Integration (2030s Plan)
- Host on Mac Pro or equivalent neural hardware
- Open-source local LLM fallback via Ollama or Mistral
- Integrate health sensors, smart environment inputs
- Learn from interaction style and mood/energy over time
- Privacy-preserving personal LLM + encrypted memory

---

## 🪢 Philosophy & Ethos
- Assist, don’t overwhelm
- Calm, intentional interaction
- Freedom + structure
- “Leave space in the day. That’s where life hides.”

---

## 🔜 In Progress / Next Milestones
- [ ] Visual task UI
- [ ] SOD ↔ EOD transition automation
- [ ] Module log auto-activation
- [ ] Journal summarizer & mood tracker
- [ ] `generate_sod_from_eod()` script

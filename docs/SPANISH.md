## 🎯 Purpose / Why This Matters
- Build conversational Spanish fluency for travel, cultural connection, and family legacy.
- Reinforce cognitive agility and memory through structured daily language practice.
- Serve as a personal proof-of-concept for AI-assisted language learning and data-driven self-education.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Daily effort beats sporadic cramming — consistency over intensity.
- Mistakes are signals, not failures — they're data points to improve from.

## 🧪 Experimental Approach
- **Daily Activity**: Complete a Duolingo Spanish session (5–15 min). Video length 15min max.
- **Capture**: Record each session via iPhone (video or voice).
- **Analyze**:
  - Vocabulary exposure (new + repeated words)
  - Grammar structures by theme (e.g., verbs, gender, plural)
  - Missed or hesitant responses
  - Repetition frequency across sessions
- **Output**:
  - Individual CSV logs per day stored in `logs/Spanish`
  - Cumulative master vocab log with frequency and accuracy tracking

## 📊 Metrics of Progress
- # of unique Spanish words encountered
- % of words seen ≥ 3x with no mistakes
- Ability to respond accurately to travel scenarios (airport, food, directions)
- Passive comprehension of audio over time

## 🧰 Tools (Current + Future)
- **Duolingo** (core daily lesson engine)
- **iPhone Recording** (audio/video of sessions)
- **ChatGPT** (data mining, logs, feedback)
- **GeorgeAI** (integration with daily logs and summaries)
- **Quillzet** (future flashcard/review platform)

## 🛠️ Data Structure
Each session produces a CSV with:
Word (Spanish), English, Part of Speech, Lesson Type, Missed/Hesitation, Count, Count Incorrect, Notes
Example rows:
carta, letter, noun, Plurals, No, 1, 0, Common word
comen, eat, verb, Present Tense, Yes, 1, 1, Hesitation before answer
niño, boy, noun, Basics, Yes, 2, 1, Selected wrong option first

These files are stored per session (e.g., `duolingo_2025-05-16.csv`) and also contribute to a cumulative master file for trend mining (`spanish_vocab_master.csv`).

## 🧩 Enhancements (Future Additions)
- AI pronunciation feedback based on recorded audio
- Dictation practice (listen + type)
- Auto-generated journal prompts from frequent vocab
- Flashcard exports for Quizlet or Anki
- Weekly summaries and error pattern detection

## 🧘‍♂️ Mindset
This is a *marathon, not a sprint*. The goal is joyful, steady, lifelong engagement with the Spanish language.

*“Un paso a la vez. La constancia vence al talento cuando el talento no se aplica.”*

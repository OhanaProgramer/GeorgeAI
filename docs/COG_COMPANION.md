# 🧠 GeorgeAI: Cognitive Companion Daily Micro Focus

This file tracks micro-explorations to deepen GeorgeAI’s role as a *Cognitive Companion* and *Daily Ops System*.

Rather than a standalone project, this is part of the daily rhythm — like the Unity micro-dev blocks. Each day we’ll touch one topic from the list below and reflect or act incrementally.

---

## 🔄 Daily Micro Topics (One at a Time)
- Resilience Loop: Mental health state check-ins & recovery mode toggle
- Intent Stack: Memory stitching and long-horizon coherence
- Command Reflexes: Triggered scripts and behavior nudges
- Vault of You: Centralized personal wisdom and mental repository
- Weekly Ops Review: Reflective audit and adaptive realignment
